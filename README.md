# Little Genius Academy
Welcome to Little Genius Academy! An interactive, gamified and safe learning platform for kids aged 5-7 that helps them practice English/Math concepts through fun quizzes and challenges while providing progress tracking.

## Purpose
The purpose of Little Genius Academy is to provide a fun and engaging learning platform for young children. Our goal is to foster creativity, critical thinking, and a love for learning through interactive activities and educational games. We aim to support parents and educators in nurturing the intellectual and emotional growth of children in a safe and supportive environment.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. "Little Genius Academy" has been developed as part of Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development Bootcamp as our 1st heckathon project.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages
The project is deployed using GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages allows you to host your website directly from your GitHub repository. To deploy the project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure your repository has an `index.html` file at the root.
2. Navigate to the repository settings.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`).
5. Click "Save" and your site will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed on your machine:
- Git
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Running the Project
Since this project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project. Alternatively, you can use a live server extension in your code editor to serve the project locally.

### Making Changes
1. Open the project in your code editor.
2. Make your changes to the code.
3. Save the files.

### Committing and Pushing Changes when working in team

1. **Create a New Branch**
  Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```

2. **Make Changes**
  Make your changes in the new branch. Ensure that your changes are well-documented and tested.

3. **Commit Changes**
  Add and commit your changes with a descriptive message:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Description of changes"
  ```

4. **Push Changes**
  Push your branch to the remote repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch-name>
  ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
  Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request. Describe the changes you made and request a review from your team members.

6. **Code Review**
  Team members should review the pull request, provide feedback, and request changes if necessary. Once approved, the pull request can be merged into the main branch.

7. **Merge Changes**
  After the pull request is approved, merge the changes into the main branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git merge <branch-name>
  ```

8. **Update Local Repository**
  Ensure your local repository is up-to-date with the main branch:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

By following these steps, you can effectively collaborate with your team and maintain a clean and organized codebase.
