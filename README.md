# Little Genius Academy
Welcome to Little Genius Academy!

## Purpose
The purpose of Little Genius Academy is to provide a fun and engaging learning platform for young children. Our goal is to foster creativity, critical thinking, and a love for learning through interactive activities and educational games. We aim to support parents and educators in nurturing the intellectual and emotional growth of children in a safe and supportive environment.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. "Little Genius Academy" has been developed as part of Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development Bootcamp as our 1st heckathon project. 

## Responsive Image

To ensure that images are responsive and look good on all devices, you can use the following HTML code snippet:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
```

This code will make sure that the image scales properly with the size of the screen while maintaining its aspect ratio.
